Background/Foreground Key handler

Allows a developer the ability using the C# stack the ability of sending background keypresses and mouse events to any process.

This is useful for any type of automation, or testing.  Although it's original roots come from being the key input handler for a botting program for the Aion online MMORPG.  Since then it has been tested with many more applications and proven to be a solid library for background input events.

Demo added that shows this process working on the standard Notepad application, which only accepts Foreground input.  Use notepad++ or another application to test background key presses.
